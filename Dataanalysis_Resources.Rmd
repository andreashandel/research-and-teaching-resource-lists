# Specific Topics

## Data cleaning and checking

* Check out the R packages tidyr, plyr, dplyr, validate, vtreat (you can find good documentation for all of them)

* [Data Analysis and Visualization Using R](http://varianceexplained.org/RData/)

* [A nice series of blog posts describing common data manipulations for dplyr](https://suzan.rbind.io/2018/01/dplyr-tutorial-1/)


## Visualization

* [R Graph Gallery](http://www.r-graph-gallery.com/): Has lots of examples of graphs and plots in R, including the underlying code that produced the graph. Great place to find a graph similar to one you'd like to make, take the code and adjust it.


## Missing Data/Imputation

* Check out R packages mi, mice, Amelia, missforest, imputation

* Little & Rubin "Statistical Analysis with Missing Data, 2nd Edition"



## p-values

* [Nice discussion of p-values](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/not-even-scientists-can-easily-explain-p-values/)

* [Another stab at p-values](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/statisticians-found-one-thing-they-can-agree-on-its-time-to-stop-misusing-p-values/)

* [Another good discussion of the problem with p-values](https://emcrit.org/pulmcrit/p-value-cutoffs/)


## Epidemiology specific topics

* [tableone](https://cran.r-project.org/package=tableone) - A package that allows for convenient creation of a descriptive table based on a data frame.

* [compareGroups](https://cran.r-project.org/package=compareGroups) - A package that allows for convenient creation of result tables from linear and logistic (and related) models.

* The [R survival package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/survival/index.html) - Lots of functionality for survival analysis.

## Time-series analysis

* The [R survival package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/survival/index.html) - Lots of functionality for survival analysis.
