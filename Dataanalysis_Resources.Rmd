# Data Analysis books

* [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/) - Probably the first book you should read if you plan on doing any serious data analysis in R. The focus is on the initial steps of an analysis (usually the most important ones). Not much coverage of statistical modeling. The book is freely available online.

* [Introduction to Statistical Learning](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/) - This book is your logical next step. Once you got your data cleaned and done preliminary analyses following the instructions in the previous book, this book will teach different statistical modeling/analysis approaches. Also R based and freely available online.

* [Elements of Statistical Learning](http://statweb.stanford.edu/~tibs/ElemStatLearn/) - This is the more advanced version by some of the same authors of the previous book. It gets technical, so only suitable once you got the basics figured out.

* [Introduction to Data Science](http://jsresearch.net/index.html)

* [Data Science in Education](https://datascienceineducation.com/) - all R, nice walk-through case-studies of different datasets and topics one might encounter in education.

* [Deep Learning book](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/)

* [Stat 545](https://stat545.com/) - Jenny Bryan's book based on her previous teaching of a course by that name (see above)

* [The Effect: An Introduction to Research Design and Causality](https://theeffectbook.net/) - focus on causal inference.

# Online tutorials

* [A Computerworld tutorial on data wrangling](http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9243391/4_data_wrangling_tasks_in_R_for_advanced_beginners)



# Useful data-analysis related R packages

* [Caret](http://topepo.github.io/caret/index.html) - a package that allows many different modeling approaches from a single interface

* [Machine Learning in R - mlR](https://github.com/mlr-org/mlr) - similar concept as Caret but different strengths and weaknesses. I would check out both.

*  [Collection of R packages for dealing with data](http://www.computerworld.com/article/2921176/business-intelligence/great-r-packages-for-data-import-wrangling-visualization.html)

* [The tidyverse](http://tidyverse.org/) - Hadley Wickham & Co's packages for all things data analysis.


# Random stuff

* [A nice cartoon-supported illustration of Hill's criteria for causality, applied to Data analysis](http://livefreeordichotomize.com/2016/12/15/hill-for-the-data-scientist-an-xkcd-story/)


# Specific Topics

## Data cleaning and checking

* Check out the R packages tidyr, plyr, dplyr, validate, vtreat (you can find good documentation for all of them)

* [Data Analysis and Visualization Using R](http://varianceexplained.org/RData/)

* [A nice series of blog posts describing common data manipulations for dplyr](https://suzan.rbind.io/2018/01/dplyr-tutorial-1/)


## Visualization

* [R Graph Gallery](http://www.r-graph-gallery.com/): Has lots of examples of graphs and plots in R, including the underlying code that produced the graph. Great place to find a graph similar to one you'd like to make, take the code and adjust it.


## Missing Data/Imputation

* Check out R packages mi, mice, Amelia, missforest, imputation

* Little & Rubin "Statistical Analysis with Missing Data, 2nd Edition"


## Bayesian Analysis

* The [Statistical Rethinking book](https://xcelab.net/rm/statistical-rethinking/)

* [Lecture notes from Mark Lai's class](https://bookdown.org/marklhc/notes_bookdown/)

* [brms package site](https://github.com/paul-buerkner/brms)


## p-values

* [Nice discussion of p-values](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/not-even-scientists-can-easily-explain-p-values/)

* [Another stab at p-values](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/statisticians-found-one-thing-they-can-agree-on-its-time-to-stop-misusing-p-values/)

* [Great example explaining what p-values do and don't mean](http://livefreeordichotomize.com/2017/08/14/why-you-maybe-shouldnt-care-about-that-p-value/)
