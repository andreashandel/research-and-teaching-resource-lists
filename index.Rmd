# Overview

This small website contains a collection of lists with links to various resources that are related to my ([Andreas Handel](https://www.andreashandel.com/)) research and teaching, as well as some general (academic) career content.

This mainly a collection of links to other sources. Some pages contain a few of my own thoughts on specific topics. The content is heavily biased toward my work. For research topics, the focus is in statistics/data analysis, infectious disease modeling and the R programming language. The other lists focus on research/academic careers and topics related to it.

Some lists contain a decent amount of information, others are fairly short/empty. All of the lists are subject to (infrequent) change/updates - whenever I get to it or come across sources I find interesting enough to 'bookmark' by adding them to one of the lists.

The main reason for these lists is so I can find stuff again. If others benefit from some of the listed links, even better.

If you have suggestions for updates/improvements or something doesn't work, let me know (using github issues or pull requests).
